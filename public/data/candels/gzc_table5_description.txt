Description: Galaxies identified in Galaxy Zoo: CANDELS as "smooth", having 1 < z < 3 and 
             mu_sb < 24.5 mag arcsec^âˆ’2 and bulge-to-total ratio less than 50 per cent 
             (flux-summed across IJH bands) according to the MegaMorph project (Hauessler et al. 2013).
             There are a total of 1,096 galaxies in this table.
